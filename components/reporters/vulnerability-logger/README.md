# vulnerability logger

This development helper component implements a [reporter](https://github.com/smithy-security/smithy/blob/main/sdk/component/component.go). The purpose of this logger is to print vulnerabilities in a cli with the fields that current smithy cares about instead of printing the whole of OCSF.

To test this component, you can run any example workflow that uses it, e.g. bandit.
